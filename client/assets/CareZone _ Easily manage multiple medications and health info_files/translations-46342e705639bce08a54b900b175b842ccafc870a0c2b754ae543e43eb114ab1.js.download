It's important to know how to respond to all seizures, including the most noticeable kind \u2013 generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or convulsions.\n\nHere are a few key steps to providing seizure first aid, from the Epilepsy Foundation:\n\u2022 Keep calm and reassure other nearby people.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t hold the person down or try to stop his movements.\n\u2022 Time the seizure with your watch.\n\u2022 Clear the area around the person of anything hard or sharp.\n\u2022 Loosen ties or anything around the neck that may make breathing difficult.\n\u2022 Put something flat and soft, like a folded jacket, under the head.\n\u2022 Turn him or her gently onto one side. This will help keep the airway clear.\n\u2022 Do not try to force the mouth open with any hard implement or with fingers. It is not true that a person having a seizure can swallow his tongue.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t attempt artificial respiration, except in the unlikely event that a person does not start breathing again after the seizure has stopped.\n\nYou can also see a video that highlights good practices for epilepsy first aid here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2jS5-0a0GE&feature=youtu.be\n\nFor a great deal more, visit the First Aid resource page at the Epilepsy Foundation: http://www.epilepsyfoundation.org/aboutepilepsy/firstaid/index.cfm\n\n(Tip: if you'd like to remain on CareZone, hold \u2018Control,\u2019 \u2018Command\u2019 on Mac, or \u2018Shift\u2019 while clicking the links.)"},note5:{body:"Medications database\n\nThe Epilepsy Foundation has created a database full of commonly prescribed seizure disorder medications, from Ativan to Zonegran.

Instead of discharging electrical energy in a controlled manner, the brain cells keep firing. The result may be a surge of energy through the brain, which causes unconsciousness and contractions of the muscles.\n\nIf only part of the brain is affected, it may cloud awareness, block normal communication, and produce a variety of undirected, uncontrolled, unorganized movements.\n\nThere are many types of seizures, too.
